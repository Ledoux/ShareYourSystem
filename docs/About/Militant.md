0. Pick the good things of the R&D managing system :

1. Short scale problem : Big data and the soup of results, so as the end of the toy models 
hegemony. Science becomes again a cooperativ system and not constrained by the neopositivism
classic pressure.

2. Long term problem :

	b. Fragmentation of the globalized research because of the return in a bipolarized world
	c. Danger of lacking elementary supplies and work stations per worker because of the approaching
		ratio of the ressources.

5. Rousseau utopy : Finding a form of research that is a bridge between a support to a public system
but with local autonomous cooperativs of development. (I have a dream)
