# ShareYourSystem 

1. Problem of the "fractalization" of the research space.

2. Although each work of a phD/post-doc situation has a very specialized designed goal,
90% of the tasks are shared by others : setting mathematical frameworks, 
implementing equations, storing outputs of simulations, analyzing data, plotting results versus parameters.

3. Graphic of the quantity of code that is necessary to publish compared to quantity of code written (that is redundant).

4. Peer-review system is it still a robust feedback. What is the constitution of a scientific result :
Today a publication is : Mathematical proofs and dialectic around figures (frontend). But a science attestation
is also the reunion with : a check on the data sources like a survey in history (model/backend access), possibly
a dialectic on the code (controller understanding), a proposed generic test framework (like a quality factor for a product) 
and in dreams a equivalent platform for displaying and sharing figures (problem of the view).
Reference to open science, hack your phd...

5. Results tends to say that the economic system can collapse by different way because of the too big interactions
between public supplies. How the research field can still live despite the perturbations to come and transform itself like agricuture, elecricity local cooperativ systems, and still at the system make resist the public CNRS research to be maintained.

6. ShareYourSystem is not THE ontology of scientific objects. The purpose here is to propose the interesting 
access of the Library Reference which gives the complete sorted dismantling of all the necessary parts of the application.
It would have here a pedagogical will : how can we build a chain of single heritance classes that helps in 
the end to configure a hierarchical MVC with a DRY philosophy. Each module/class in the chain of the logical building
is open to be discussed and transformed/branched and remerged deeper in the chain by whoever wants.

7. Choosing its language for computing scientific results is still a first obstacle for making a team in a lab like a 
cooperative system... Here is proposed a combination of 3 languages for handling classic jobs in making results :
Python for being the controller platform of any other piped processing languages, and setting the ontology of objects, 
a Swigged C++ for doing hard computations, Javascript for playing with grided widgets in order to visualize data and results.
